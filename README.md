# Case-Study-Analyzing-Customer-Churn-in-Power-BI

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI case study, we'll investigate a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. We'll answer these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.

## Step One: Exploratory Analysis
We start exploring the new dataset and revisit creating measures in Power BI to get a better understanding of why customers are churning.

- Data Analysis Flow in the Power Bi:
  - Data Check
  - Explor Data
  - Analyze and Visualise Data
  - Dashboarding
  - Communicate Insights

## Step Two: Investigating Churn Patterns
We'll continue by leveraging the Power BI knowledge we have gained to further investigate why customers are leaving Databel.

## Step Three: Visualizing the Analysis
We create dashboard-style pages and arrange them into stories, so that we can share the results with stakeholders.
